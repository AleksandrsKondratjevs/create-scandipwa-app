# Breaking change in 4.0.0

If you're using the CLI options `--react-scripts`. `--scripts-version`, or `--workspace` your `craco` setup will not work for 4.0.0.

## The easy fix

`--react-scripts`, `--scripts-version` and `--workspace` are now configurable in the `craco.config.js` file.

You can setup your `craco.config` file with

```javascript
{
    workspace: true|false,
    reactScriptsVersion: ""
    reactScriptsPath: "";
}
```

## You import craPaths in your craco.config.js file

`craPath` cannot be imported anymore in `craco.config.js file`.

You can access the CRA paths when they are provided as `context` to functions.

If they are missing at key spots, open issue.
