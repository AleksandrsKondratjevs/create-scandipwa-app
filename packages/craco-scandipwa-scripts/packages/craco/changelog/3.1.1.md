# Breaking change in 3.1.1

As of 2.1.2 `create-react-app` is using a single webpack configuration file instead of 2 for the previous versions.

The `craco` code has been updated to reflect the changes.

This means that `craco` is not compatible anymore with version of `react-scripts` prior to 2.1.2.
